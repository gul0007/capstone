# CS50 WEB - FINAL PROJECT (capstone)

## Description
This is my final project for the course CS50 WEB. It's a File Management system using python and django that I have created to help people save their personal files MP3 or MP4 in their login account users can edit, update or delete their personal files according to their needs and this is a pretty versatile project perfect to be considered as a CAPSTONE a file management web application that will allow users to add, update, and delete files using Django. The web application supports pdf, image, document, audio, and video files. The User Registration allows the user to register themselves to upload the files, files that are already uploaded can be downloaded without login. The Add File allows the user to add title, description, and upload the file in any of the supported formats. The Edit File allows the uploaded file to be changes. The Delete File allows the user to delete files that they have uploaded. User can edit the description and details of their profile. The Django Admin Interface allows the site administrator to view, add, edit, and delete any file and user on the application. I am confident that project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements mentioned for the capstone project!
